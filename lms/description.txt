I have 3 antennas oriented / rotated by120 degree from each other. Their diagram is of the shape of a symbol '8'. I need the single tap LMS filter with 2 inputs (sample -by -sample manner) of type complex double - for receiving signals from 2 different antennas, and an error signal output also in complex double format. I need also the argument (angle) calculated from this output. The filter must be initiated to persist during existence time of a program, and then it must be called for each step to process a next sample and produce a next error value. DEfine the parameters required to mitigate noise in the inputs. All must be written in C.


To create an LMS (Least Mean Squares) adaptive filter for combining the signals from two antennas, we'll use the following approach:

Problem Breakdown:

Inputs:

Two antennas, each receiving complex signals, will be used as inputs.

Each antenna's output is a complex number representing a sample in the form a + bi (where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part).

Output:

The filter will output a complex error signal based on the difference between the desired signal and the output of the filter. The desired signal is typically the reference signal, which may be a known or expected value.

The angle of the error signal will be calculated based on its complex form.

Filter Operation:

The LMS filter will adjust the filter weights (complex coefficients) to minimize the error signal (using the least mean squares approach).

The filter will process the signals sample-by-sample and will be persistent during the program's runtime.

Design Outline:

Initialize the filter with a complex double input.

Process each sample by updating the filter coefficients.

Calculate the error signal by subtracting the filter output from the desired signal.

Compute the angle of the error signal from its complex form.

LMS Update Rule:

The LMS algorithm adjusts the filter weights iteratively to minimize the error signal using the following rule:

𝑤(𝑛+1)=𝑤(𝑛)+𝜇⋅𝑥(𝑛)⋅𝑒∗(𝑛)w(n+1)=w(n)+μ⋅x(n)⋅e∗(n)

Where:

w(n) is the filter weight at step n.

x(n) is the input signal vector at step n.

e(n) is the error signal at step n.

μ is the step size or learning rate.

e^*(n) is the complex conjugate of the error signal.

LMS Filter Implementation in C:

We'll write a C function to handle the LMS adaptive filtering, error signal calculation, and angle computation.

Explanation:

Initialization (lms_filter_init): Initializes the filter with two weights (one for each antenna). The desired signal is also provided here.

LMS Filter Output (lms_filter_output): The filter computes a weighted sum of the two antenna inputs using the current weights.

Error Signal (lms_filter_error): The error signal is computed as the difference between the desired signal and the filter's output.

Filter Update (lms_filter_update): The filter weights are updated based on the LMS algorithm, using the error signal and input samples.

Error Angle (calculate_error_angle): The phase (angle) of the error signal is computed using the carg function, which returns the angle (in radians) of a complex number.

How the Adaptive Filter Works:

At Initialization: The filter is initialized with weights for both antenna signals (which are initially set to zero) and a desired reference signal.

For Each Sample:

The filter computes the weighted sum of the two antenna signals.

The error signal is calculated as the difference between the desired signal and the filter output.

The weights are updated using the LMS rule, adjusting them in the direction that minimizes the error signal.

Angle Calculation: The phase (or angle) of the error signal is computed, which gives you the orientation of the signal based on the error (useful for beamforming or signal alignment).

Parameters to Mitigate Noise:

Step size (MU): The step size (MU) controls how fast the filter adapts to changes. A smaller value will result in slower adaptation, which might be more robust against noise.

Input Signal Smoothing: You can smooth your input signal if noise is high. This can be done by averaging the inputs over a small window (e.g., low-pass filtering).

Learning Rate (MU): The MU parameter controls the learning rate of the filter. It should be chosen carefully to avoid divergence or slow convergence.

Next Steps:

Real-time Data: Integrate this code with real-time data input from your antennas (e.g., from a hardware interface or software receiver).

Noise Mitigation: Explore further noise filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filters, Wiener filters) if required.

Beamforming: Extend this filter for use in beamforming by using the angles derived from the error signal to combine antenna data in a specific direction.
